My name is Joshua Lee and I was born and raised in Seattle, Washington. I am currently a student studying quality assurance at this program called YearUp. Prior to this, I had some experience with customer support and volunteer work which has allowed me to gain communication and adaptability skills. I would like to reach a point where I can expand and add on to those soft skills because I believe it will help develop my career in the future. My main goal following this program is to be employed at any given tech company so I can support my family in any way because they have created many opportunities to allow me to be where I am today.
